## Part 6: Q&A Tips
**‚è±Ô∏è Duration: Remaining time**

### Common Questions & Answers:

#### Q: "How accurate is the resume screening?"
**A:** "The system uses Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model, which 
understands semantic meaning, not just keywords. It's more accurate than 
traditional ATS systems because it considers context, experience relevance, 
and skill alignment holistically."

#### Q: "Can it handle different resume formats?"
**A:** "Yes, it extracts text from PDF resumes regardless of format. The AI 
is trained to understand various resume structures and can identify key 
information even from non-standard layouts."

#### Q: "What about bias in AI evaluation?"
**A:** "The system evaluates based on technical competency and job requirements 
only. It doesn't have access to demographic information. The evaluation criteria 
are consistent for all candidates, actually reducing human bias."

#### Q: "How long does screening take?"
**A:** "For 50 resumes, approximately 1-2 minutes for complete processing. 
This includes PDF text extraction, embedding generation, similarity calculation, 
and ranking. Traditional manual screening would take hours."

#### Q: "Can we customize the interview questions?"
**A:** "Yes, the question count is configurable (3-10 questions). The questions 
are dynamically generated based on the job description and candidate's resume, 
ensuring relevance while maintaining consistency."

#### Q: "What about candidates without technical backgrounds?"
**A:** "The AI adapts to the role requirements. For non-technical positions, 
it focuses on relevant skills, experience, and behavioral aspects appropriate 
for that role."

#### Q: "How secure is the candidate data?"
**A:** "All data is stored in MongoDB with proper authentication. Temporary 
candidate accounts expire after 24 hours. Resume PDFs and interview transcripts 
are access-controlled by recruiter ID."

#### Q: "Can multiple recruiters use the system?"
**A:** "Yes, the system supports multiple recruiter accounts. Each recruiter 
has their own dashboard showing only their job postings, screenings, and 
interview assignments."

#### Q: "What's the cost compared to manual screening?"
**A:** "If a recruiter spends 10 minutes per resume, screening 100 resumes 
takes ~17 hours. Our system does it in ~2 minutes. That's a 99% time reduction. 
The ROI is immediate."

#### Q: "Can we integrate with our existing ATS?"
**A:** "The system provides APIs that can be integrated with existing tools. 
The screening results can be exported as CSV for import into other systems."
