# Resume Screening System - Top-K Ranking Implementation

## Overview
Transformed the resume screening system from individual match scoring to a **top-K similarity ranking system** that analyzes all uploaded resumes and returns only the most similar ones.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Backend Service (`resume_service.py`)**

#### Removed:
- `screen_resume()` - Individual resume scoring method

#### Added:
- `process_resume()` - Processes individual resumes (extract name, generate embedding, create ID)
- `rank_resumes()` - **NEW MAIN METHOD** - Ranks all resumes against JD and returns top K
- `_extract_candidate_name()` - Helper to extract candidate names
- `_calculate_similarity_score()` - Converts distance to 0-100 similarity score

#### Key Improvements:
✅ **Batch Processing**: All resumes processed together for efficient ranking  
✅ **Top-K Selection**: Only returns the most similar candidates (default: 5)  
✅ **Better Similarity Calculation**: Improved distance-to-score conversion  
✅ **Input Validation**: Validates JD text length and top_k values  
✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Better tracking of the ranking process  
✅ **Error Resilience**: Continues processing even if some resumes fail  

---

### 2. **API Routes (`resume_routes.py`)**

#### Changes to `/screen` endpoint:
- Added `top_k` parameter (default: 5)
- Changed from processing resumes individually to **batch processing**
- Now collects all resumes first, then ranks them together
- Returns only top K candidates sorted by similarity
- Enhanced error messages and validation

#### Response Changes:
```python
# Old Response
{
    "results": [...],  # All resumes, sorted by score
    "total_processed": 10
}

# New Response
{
    "results": [...],  # Only top K resumes, ranked
    "total_uploaded": 15,
    "total_processed": 12,  # Some may fail extraction
    "top_k": 5,
    "job_title": "..."
}
```

#### Backward Compatibility:
- GET endpoints handle both old (`match_score`) and new (`similarity_score`) formats
- Existing database records still work

---

### 3. **Data Models (`resume_model.py`)**

#### Updated `ResumeScreenResponse`:
```python
# Old
match_score: int

# New
similarity_score: float  # More precise (e.g., 87.3%)
rank: int  # Ranking position (1, 2, 3...)
```

#### Updated `BatchScreenResponse`:
Added fields:
- `total_uploaded`: Total resumes uploaded
- `total_processed`: Successfully processed resumes
- `top_k`: Number of top candidates returned

---

### 4. **Streamlit UI (`resume_screener.py`)**

#### New Features:
✅ **Top-K Slider**: User can select how many top candidates to see (1-20)  
✅ **Ranking Display**: Shows rank number for each candidate  
✅ **Similarity Scores**: Displays precise percentages (e.g., 87.3%)  
✅ **Metrics Dashboard**: Shows top candidate info at a glance  
✅ **Updated Messaging**: "Rank Resumes & Get Top Candidates"  

#### UI Improvements:
- Step 3 added: Select number of top candidates
- Changed "Match Score" → "Similarity Score"
- Added rank badges in detailed view
- Enhanced results table with rank column
- Better color coding for status

## How It Works Now

### **Old Workflow:**
```
Upload 15 PDFs → Process each individually → Score each → Return all 15 sorted
```

### **New Workflow:**
```
Upload 15 PDFs → Extract text from all → Generate embeddings → 
Store in ChromaDB → Rank all by similarity → Return only top 5
```

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Better User Experience**
- Recruiters see only the best matches
- Reduces information overload
- Focuses attention on top candidates

### 2. **More Accurate Ranking**
- All resumes compared in one batch
- Relative ranking is more meaningful
- Better similarity calculations

### 3. **Improved Performance**
- JD embedding generated only once
- Batch queries to ChromaDB
- Less data transferred to frontend

### 4. **Code Quality**
- Better error handling
- Input validation
- Comprehensive docstrings
- More maintainable structure

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Default (Top 5)
```python
# Upload 20 resumes for a Python developer role
# System analyzes all 20
# Returns top 5 most similar candidates
```

### Example 2: Custom Top-K
```python
# Upload 100 resumes
# Set slider to 10
# System returns top 10 candidates
```

### Example 3: Small Batch
```python
# Upload 3 resumes
# System returns all 3 ranked
```

---

## API Changes

### POST `/api/resume/screen`

**New Parameter:**
- `top_k` (int, default=5): Number of top candidates to return

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "candidate_name": "John Doe",
      "similarity_score": 87.3,
      "rank": 1,
      "status": "Strong Match",
      "summary": "Ranked #1 out of 15 candidates...",
      "resume_path": "..."
    }
  ],
  "total_uploaded": 15,
  "total_processed": 15,
  "top_k": 5,
  "job_title": "Senior Python Developer"
}
```

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload 15 PDFs, verify only top 5 returned
- [ ] Adjust top_k slider, verify correct number returned
- [ ] Upload fewer resumes than top_k, verify all returned
- [ ] Check similarity scores are between 0-100
- [ ] Verify ranks are sequential (1, 2, 3...)
- [ ] Test with invalid PDFs (should skip and continue)
- [ ] Verify ChromaDB stores all resumes
- [ ] Check MongoDB saves only top K
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with old results

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Parallel Embedding Generation**: Process multiple resumes simultaneously
2. **Skills Extraction**: Use LLM to extract and match specific skills
3. **Experience Filtering**: Filter by years of experience before ranking
4. **Custom Weights**: Allow recruiters to weight different criteria
5. **Explanation**: Show why each candidate was ranked in that position
6. **Resume Parsing**: Extract structured data (education, work history)
7. **Batch API**: Support multiple JDs at once

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (unchanged)
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
AZURE_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
```

### Default Values
```python
top_k = 5  # Number of top candidates
similarity_threshold = 80  # For "Strong Match" status
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Old database records with `match_score` still work  
✅ GET endpoints handle both old and new formats  
✅ UI displays both field names correctly  
✅ No migration needed for existing data  

---

## Summary

The system now operates as a **true ranking system** rather than a scoring system:
- ✅ Processes all resumes together
- ✅ Returns only the top K most similar candidates
- ✅ Provides clear ranking positions
- ✅ More efficient and scalable
- ✅ Better user experience for recruiters

**Result:** Recruiters can upload many resumes and instantly see the best matches, saving time and improving hiring decisions.
